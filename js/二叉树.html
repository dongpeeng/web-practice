Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

       3
     /   \
    5     1
   / \   / \
  6   2 0   8
     / \
    7   4

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
Example 2:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
 

Note:

All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

var lowerCommonAncestor = function (root,p,q){
    if(!root||root===p||root===q) return root
    let left=lowerCommonAncestor(root.left,p,q)
    let right=lowerCommonAncestor(root.right,p,q)
    if (left&&right){
        return root
    }
    return left? left:right 
 
}

console.log(lowerCommonAncestor([3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4],5,4));
